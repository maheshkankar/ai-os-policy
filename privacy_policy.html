    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    
    <h3>A. Personal Information</h3>
    <p>We may collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when you register for the App, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Name and Email address (via Google Sign-In)</li>
        <li>Phone number (via Firebase Phone Authentication)</li>
        <li>Business profile information (e.g., business name, address)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>B. Device and Usage Data</h3>
    <p>We may automatically collect information about your device, including IP address, device model, operating system version, and app usage statistics to improve our services.</p>

    <h2>2. Permissions and Sensitive Data</h2>
    <p>To provide its core features, AI-OS requires access to certain sensitive permissions on your device. We request these permissions only when necessary.</p>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h3>Accessibility Service API Disclosure</h3>
        <p><strong>Why we use it:</strong> AI-OS uses the Android Accessibility Service API to function as an intelligent business assistant. This permission allows the App to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Read screen content to understand the context of your business tasks.</li>
            <li>Perform automated actions on your behalf to streamline workflows.</li>
            <li>Assist in navigating complex business applications.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Data Handling:</strong> Data collected via the Accessibility Service is used <strong>solely</strong> to execute the specific tasks you request. We do not use this API to collect sensitive user data (such as passwords or credit card numbers) for any other purpose, nor do we share this data with third parties for marketing purposes.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Camera</h3>
    <p>We request camera access to allow you to scan documents, QR codes, or capture images relevant to your business operations.</p>

    <h3>Contacts</h3>
    <p>We request access to your contacts to help you manage your business relationships and integrate with your CRM workflows directly within the App.</p>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the collected information to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Provide, operate, and maintain the App.</li>
        <li>Authenticate your identity and secure your account.</li>
        <li>Personalize your experience and deliver business insights.</li>
        <li>Improve our AI models and services (using anonymized data).</li>
        <li>Communicate with you regarding updates, security alerts, and support.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We may share data with trusted third-party service providers to facilitate our services:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Firebase:</strong> For authentication (Google Sign-In, Phone Auth) and analytics.</li>
        <li><strong>Cloud Infrastructure:</strong> To host our backend services and databases.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These third parties have access to your Personal Information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your data. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our Services are not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>
